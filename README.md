# Anomaly Detection in SS7 Traffic - Test Traffic Generators and Detection Algorithms
This repository contains code that runs simulations for anomaly detection in SS7 networks, and that implements two different approaches to detecting anomalies.

* In the folder [simulator](./simulator), you find [grid world-based](./simulator/gridworld) and [graph-based](./simulator/network) simulator tools.

* In the root folder, you find two Jupyter notebooks that run the anomaly detection scripts.
