# Anomaly Detection in SS7 Traffic - Test Traffic Generators and Detection Algorithms
This repository contains code that runs simulations for anomaly detection in SS7 networks, and that implements two different approaches to detecting anomalies.

* In the folder [simulator](./simulator), you find [grid world-based](./simulator/gridworld) and [graph-based](./simulator/network) simulator tools.

* In the folder [anomaly-detector](./anomaly-detector), you find a Bayesian filter-approach for identifying malicious agents (attackers) in the grid world, and for identifying corrupted nodes in the graph.

* In the folder [python-simulation](./python-simulation), you find some tools and utilities to play around with SS7 messages.
